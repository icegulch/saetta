  Saetta, or **/sa’et.ta/** is an old Italian word meaning “lightning” or
  “quick”.


  Saetta Labs was founded to produce the highest performing and lowest phase noise microwave oscillators. The core technology is based on a whispering gallery mode sapphire loaded cavity (SLC). The company’s goal is to bring this technology from the physics lab to the microwave system designer. Applications are anywhere low phase noise is required: radar, calibration, measurement and communications.

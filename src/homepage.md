  The core technology of Saetta Labs is based on a whispering gallery mode
  sapphire-loaded cavity (SLC). The company’s goal is to bring SLC oscillator
  technology from the physics lab to the microwave system designer. Applications
  are anywhere low phase noise is required: radar, calibration, measurement and
  communications.


  Saetta (pronounced **/sa’et.ta/)** is an old Italian word meaning “lightning” or “quick”.

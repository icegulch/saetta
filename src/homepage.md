  ## Core Technology


  The core technology of Saetta Labs is based on a whispering gallery mode sapphire-loaded cavity (SLC). The company’s goal is to bring SLC oscillator technology from the physics lab to the microwave system designer. Applications are anywhere low phase noise is required: radar, calibration, measurement and communications.

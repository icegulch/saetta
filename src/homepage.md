hero_subheading: Whispering gallery mode 8.0GHz to 12.0GHz
about_blurb: >
  Saetta, or **/sa’et.ta/** is an old Italian word meaning “lightning” or
  “quick”.


  The core technology is based on a whispering gallery mode sapphire loaded cavity (SLC). The company’s goal is to bring this technology from the physics lab to the microwave system designer. Applications are anywhere low phase noise is required: radar, calibration, measurement and communications.

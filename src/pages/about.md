Saetta Labs was founded to produce the highest performing, low phase noise microwave oscillators. The core technology is based on whispering gallery mode sapphire loaded cavity (SLC). Our goal was to bring this technology from the physics lab to the microwave systems designer and to extend the use of the technology to more mainstream applications - radar, calibration, measurement, communications.

The lowest phase noise and also most stable oscillators in the world are derived from the SLC. In fact SLC Oscillators at cryogenic temperatures have been used as transfer standards between atomic clocks that cannot be moved. SLC oscillators are also the basis of metrology grade X-band phase noise measurement systems at NIST.

## What's in a Name?

Saetta, or sa’etta is an old Italian word meaning ‘lightning’ or ‘quick’. I spend more time in the ‘lab’ that at a desk so the name Saetta Labs was born, or in English, you might say ‘lightning laboratory’. A fitting name for an purely microwave company.

It’s also the name of [my favorite wine from Italy](http://www.montebernardi.com/)...

## Jason Breitbarth

Jason received is B.S. from Oregon State (1998) and M.S. (2001) and Ph.D. (2006) from the University of Colorado. Jason’s, M.S. and Ph.D. was focused on low phase noise oscillators, components and measurement.

He was with HP/Agilent from 1998 to 2003 in the Microwave Technology Center, Santa Rosa, CA. While at HP he designed microwave subsystems for synthesizers, noise figure analyzer and time domain bit error rate testers to 43Gbit/s.

In 2004 he founded Holzworth Instrumentation and operated as the CEO/CTO while designing synthesizers and phase noise analyzers until 2020 when he sold the business, now owned by Maury Microwave. While at Holzworth, working with his design team, he designed and architected the HS, HSM, HSX and HSY synthesizers to 20GHz and HA7062A, B and C phase noise analyzers as well as many of the components.

Saetta Labs is next step in a low phase noise career. A careful focus on new oscillator technologies to drive the next generation of microwave electronics.

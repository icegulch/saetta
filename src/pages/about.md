### **Saetta Labs**

Saetta Labs was founded to produce the highest performing, lowest phase noise microwave oscillators. The core technology is based on a whispering-gallery mode sapphire loaded cavity (SLC). Our goal is to bring SLCO technology from the physics lab to the microwave systems designer and extend use of SLCO technology to broad array of applications - radar, calibration, measurement and communications.

### What's in a Name?

Saetta, or sa’etta is an old Italian word meaning ‘lightning’ or ‘quick’.  We spend more time in the ‘lab’ that at a desk.   Translated to English, you might say ‘lightning laboratory’.  A fitting name for a purely microwave company.

It’s also the name of [my favorite wine from Italy](http://www.montebernardi.com/)...

### Founder: Jason Breitbarth, Ph.D.

Jason received his B.S. from Oregon State (1998) and M.S. (2001) and Ph.D. (2006) from the University of Colorado. Jason’s, M.S. and Ph.D. was focused on low phase noise oscillators, components and measurement.

He was with HP/Agilent from 1998 to 2003 in the Microwave Technology Center, Santa Rosa, CA. While at HP he designed microwave subsystems for synthesizers, noise figure analyzers and time domain bit error rate testers to 43Gbit/s.

In 2004 he founded Holzworth Instrumentation and operated as the CEO/CTO while designing synthesizers and phase noise analyzers until 2020 when he sold the business, now owned by Maury Microwave. While at Holzworth, he architected and designed the HS, HSM, HSX and HSY synthesizers to 20GHz and HA7062A, B and C phase noise analyzers as well as many of the components.

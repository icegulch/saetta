  - title: 8GHz Sapphire Loaded Cavity Oscillator

    datasheet: /pdfs/datasheet.pdf
    description: >
      This highly integrated X-band oscillator operates fundamentally at 8GHz
      and is thermally stabilized and phase lockable to 10MHz. Measuring 4.25
      inches by 6.25 inches by 3.15 inches, it eliminates the need for all other
      intermediate oscillators used in high performance systems (100MHz OCXO,
      SAW, DRO and associated multiplier changes and PLLs.)


      It operates off a single 12V supply, consuming 2.5 Amps on startup and dropping to less than 0.5 Amps at lab temperatures.

    plot_description: >
      The ‘whispering-gallery’ mode is a pure microwave resonance within the
      sapphire operating on a reflection between dielectric boundaries of the
      sapphire and a vacuum. This eliminates metal losses and results ultra high
      Q-factor and unparalleled low phase noise performance.


      **Coming soon: 10.00GHz, 10.24GHz and 12.00GHz**

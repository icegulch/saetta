  - title: 8.0GHz / 10.0GHz / 10.24GHz Sapphire Loaded Cavity Oscillator

    description: >-
      This highly integrated X-band oscillator operates fundamentally at 8.0GHz,
      10.0GHz or 10.24GHz, is thermally stabilized and phase lockable to 10MHz.
      Measuring 4.25 inches by 6.25 inches by 3.15 inches, it eliminates the
      need for all other intermediate oscillators used in high performance
      systems (100MHz OCXO, SAW, DRO and associated multiplier changes and
      PLLs.)


      It operates off a single 12V supply, consuming 3.5 amps on startup and dropping to less than 1 amp at lab temperatures.

    plot_description: >
      The ‘whispering-gallery’ mode is a pure microwave resonance within the
      sapphire operating on a reflection between dielectric boundaries of the
      sapphire and a vacuum. This eliminates metal losses and results ultra high
      Q-factor and unparalleled low phase noise performance.


      **Coming soon: 10.00GHz, 10.24GHz and 12.00GHz**
